## Notes
- I had accustomed to explicitly tell that functions accept no parameters by adding void inside the braces while studying C. `int foo(void)` In C# this is not even possible.
- Scripts have to be assigned to an object to create a Gameobject of that class.
- On VSCode, press F2 when your variable is highlighted to rename all instances of that variable.

## Biggest blocks
- Use Screen x and screen y to control the virtual camera position.
- UI components are handled differently in rendering order than other components.
